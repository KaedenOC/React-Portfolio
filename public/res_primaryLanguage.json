      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kaeden O'Meara. I'm currently studying Software Development at Code Fellows, where I will obtain a certificate in Advanced Software Development in JavaScript. I am taking a really big step within my professional career by embracing the discomfort of changing careers. One of my greatest strengths is that I refuse to give up on something even if I don't understand it in that moment. My supervisors from my past job have commended me for my hard work, and patience. As a motivated, organized, and logical thinking individual, I aspire to further my knowledge within the tech industry, and build strong relationships with the people I network with. Thank you ðŸ’œ",
